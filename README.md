# React Hooks Examples

This repository contains examples of various React hooks and their use cases. React hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features, making class components generally no longer needed. Hooks enable us to "hook" into React features such as state management and lifecycle methods.

## Available Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook allows us to track state in a function component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracked in an application. We can change state any time using the `useState` hook.

### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is used when we have to manage multiple states. It is particularly useful when the state logic becomes complex, and you need more control over state updates.

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform actions after the component appears on the screen. It is often used for tasks such as making API calls, fetching data, or setting up subscriptions.

### useLayoutEffect

The `useLayoutEffect` hook runs synchronously immediately after all DOM mutations are applied. It is useful for performing measurements or modifying the DOM before the component is displayed.

### useRef

The `useRef` hook is primarily used to access and manipulate the underlying DOM elements directly. It can also be used to store mutable values that do not trigger re-renders when updated.

### useImperativeHandle

The `useImperativeHandle` hook allows a parent component to access and interact with certain functions or properties of its child component. It is used for specific use cases where direct interaction with the child component is necessary.

### useContext

The `useContext` hook allows you to access and share data between different components without having to pass the data down through props manually.

### useMemo

The `useMemo` hook is used to save and remember the result of a function so that it doesn't need to be recalculated every time the component re-renders.

### useCallback

The `useCallback` hook is used to optimize performance when passing functions as props to child components. It ensures that the function is not recreated on every render.

## Usage

Each hook example is available in its respective folder with detailed explanations and use cases. Clone or download the repository to explore the examples and see how these hooks can be effectively used in React applications.
